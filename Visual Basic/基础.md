### 基础

```
vbNewLine // 空行
```

```vb
Dim num As Double = 123.456
Dim formatted As String = num.ToString("0.00") ' "123.46"
Console.WriteLine(formatted)
```

```vb
Dim name As String = InputBox("请输入你的名字", "用户输入")
MessageBox.Show("你好, " & name & "!", "欢迎")
```

```vb
MsgBox("旧写法")
MessageBox.Show("新的写法")
```

```vb
Dim name As String = "Alice"
Dim age As Integer = 25
Dim price As Double = 19.99
Dim isStudent As Boolean = True
```

```vb
Dim name As String = "Alice"
Dim age As Integer = 25
Dim message As String = $"姓名: {name}, 年龄: {age}"
MessageBox.Show(message)
```

```vb
Dim stFirstName As String = "John"
MessageBox.Show("你好 " & stFirstName)
```

```vb
Dim grade As String = "B"

Select Case grade
    Case "A"
        MessageBox.Show("优秀")
    Case "B"
        MessageBox.Show("良好")
    Case "C"
        MessageBox.Show("及格")
    Case Else
        MessageBox.Show("不及格")
End Select
```

```vb
Try
    Dim x As Integer = 10
    Dim y As Integer = 0
    Dim result As Integer = x / y ' 除零错误
Catch ex As Exception
    MessageBox.Show("发生错误: " & ex.Message)
End Try
```

### 数组

```vb
Dim numbers As Integer() = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Dim names As String() = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
```

### List

```vb
Dim test As New List(Of User)()
```

```vb
Dim test As New List(Of User) From {
    New User With {.Name = "Alice", .Age = 25},
    New User With {.Name = "Bob", .Age = 30}
}
```

```vb
Dim numbers As New List(Of Integer) From {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Dim names As New List(Of String) From {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}

numbers.Add(6) ' 添加元素
numbers.Remove(3) ' 删除元素
numbers.RemoveAt(0) ' 删除索引 0 位置的元素

==

For Each num As Integer In numbers
    MessageBox.Show("数字: " & num)
Next

==

Dim exists As Boolean = numbers.Contains(3) ' 是否包含 3
MessageBox.Show("是否存在: " & exists)
```

```vb
' 创建 List<User>
Dim test As New List(Of User)()

' 添加数据
test.Add(New User With {.Name = "Alice", .Age = 25})
test.Add(New User With {.Name = "Bob", .Age = 30})

' 遍历列表
For Each user As User In test
    MessageBox.Show("姓名: " & user.Name & ", 年龄: " & user.Age)
Next
```

### LINQ 查询

```vb
Dim numbers As New List(Of Integer) From {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Dim evenNumbers = From n In numbers
                  Where n Mod 2 = 0
                  Select n

For Each num As Integer In evenNumbers
    MessageBox.Show("偶数: " & num)
Next
```

```vb
Public Class Person
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property Age As Integer
End Class

Dim people As New List(Of Person) From {
    New Person With {.Name = "Alice", .Age = 25},
    New Person With {.Name = "Bob", .Age = 30},
    New Person With {.Name = "Charlie", .Age = 22}
}

' 查询年龄大于 25 的人
Dim result = From p In people
             Where p.Age > 25
             Select p

For Each person In result
    MessageBox.Show(person.Name & " - " & person.Age)
Next
```

```vb
Dim sortedPeople = From p In people
                   Order By p.Age Ascending
                   Select p

For Each person In sortedPeople
    MessageBox.Show(person.Name & " - " & person.Age)
Next
```

### LINQ 统计（Sum, Count, Average）

```vb
Dim sumAge As Integer = people.Sum(Function(p) p.Age)
Dim avgAge As Double = people.Average(Function(p) p.Age)
Dim count As Integer = people.Count()

MessageBox.Show("总年龄: " & sumAge)
MessageBox.Show("平均年龄: " & avgAge)
MessageBox.Show("人数: " & count)
```

### 函数

```vb
Function Add(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
    Return a + b
End Function

Dim result As Integer = Add(3, 5)
MessageBox.Show("结果: " & result)
```

```

```

### 创建类和对象

```vb
Public Class Person
    Public Name As String
    Public Age As Integer

    Public Sub New(n As String, a As Integer)
        Name = n
        Age = a
    End Sub

    Public Sub ShowInfo()
        MessageBox.Show("姓名: " & Name & ", 年龄: " & Age)
    End Sub
End Class

===

Dim p As New Person("Alice", 25)
p.ShowInfo()
```
