### 解释

```
副词（程度）
"That" 表示程度，用于否定或强调，意为“那么”。

例句：
It’s not that hard.
（这并没有那么难。）
I didn’t know you were that tired.
（我不知道你那么累了。）

Easier
基本含义： “更容易的”，是形容词的比较级，用来比较两者之间的难易程度。

Earlier
基本含义： 是 early 的比较级，表示“更早、更提前”

具体到这个句子 "Should we get it engraved?"：

"Get" 表示让某人做某事，通常是指让别人来执行某个动作或任务。
"Engraved" 是指刻上文字或图案。
所以 "get it engraved" 的意思是 "让它被刻字" 或 "让别人为我们刻上东西"

Baked goods 指的是所有烘焙出来的食品，通常包括面包、饼干、蛋糕、派、松饼、面包卷等。这些食品通过烘烤的方式制作而成。简单来说，baked goods 就是各种烘焙食品的统称。

The Importance of Exercise

Exercise is very important for our health. It helps to keep our bodies strong and our minds clear. When we exercise, our muscles get stronger, and our heart becomes healthier. Exercise also helps us to feel happy because it releases chemicals in our brain that make us feel good.

There are many types of exercise that we can do. Some people like running or walking, while others enjoy swimming or cycling. Even activities like dancing or playing sports can be great ways to exercise. It doesn’t matter what you choose, as long as you enjoy it and do it regularly.

Experts recommend that we exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. This can be a mix of activities like walking, stretching, or doing some light strength training. Remember, even small amounts of exercise can make a big difference to your health.

So, try to find a fun activity that you enjoy and make it part of your daily routine. Your body and mind will thank you!

运动的重要性

运动对我们的健康非常重要。它有助于保持身体强健、头脑清醒。当我们运动时，我们的肌肉会变得更强壮，心脏也会变得更健康。运动还能让我们感到快乐，因为它会释放大脑中的化学物质，让我们感觉良好。

我们可以做很多种运动。有些人喜欢跑步或散步，而有些人喜欢游泳或骑自行车。甚至跳舞或运动等活动也是很好的锻炼方式。你选择什么并不重要，只要你喜欢并经常做就行。

专家建议我们每周五天，每天至少锻炼 30 分钟。这可以是散步、伸展运动或做一些轻度力量训练等活动的混合。记住，即使是少量的运动也能对你的健康产生很大的影响。

所以，试着找一个你喜欢的有趣活动，并把它作为你日常生活的一部分。你的身体和心灵会感谢你的！

A Healthy Diet

Eating a healthy diet is very important for staying strong and feeling good. A healthy diet means eating a variety of foods that give your body the nutrients it needs. This includes fruits, vegetables, grains, protein (like meat, fish, or beans), and dairy products (like milk and cheese).

Fruits and vegetables are very important because they are full of vitamins and minerals that help your body fight illness. Whole grains, like brown rice and whole wheat bread, provide energy and are good for your stomach. Protein helps build muscles and keeps you strong.

It’s also important to drink plenty of water. Water keeps your body hydrated and helps you stay healthy. Try to avoid too many sugary drinks, like soda or energy drinks, because they can be bad for your health if you drink them too often.

Remember, eating in a balanced way is the key to a healthy diet. You don’t need to eat only healthy foods all the time, but try to make healthy choices most of the time. A little treat now and then is okay!

健康饮食

健康饮食对于保持身体强壮和感觉良好非常重要。健康饮食意味着要吃各种各样的食物，为身体提供所需的营养。这包括水果、蔬菜、谷物、蛋白质（如肉、鱼或豆类）和乳制品（如牛奶和奶酪）。

水果和蔬菜非常重要，因为它们富含维生素和矿物质，有助于身体抵抗疾病。全谷物，如糙米和全麦面包，提供能量，对胃有好处。蛋白质有助于锻炼肌肉，让你保持强壮。

多喝水也很重要。水能让你的身体保持水分，帮助你保持健康。尽量避免喝太多含糖饮料，如苏打水或能量饮料，因为如果你喝得太频繁，它们会对你的健康有害。

记住，均衡饮食是健康饮食的关键。你不需要一直只吃健康食品，但要尽量在大多数时间做出健康的选择。偶尔吃一点零食是可以的！

Dealing with Anxiety When You Can’t Find a Job

Job hunting can be stressful, and it’s normal to feel anxious when things don’t seem to be going your way. If you are struggling to find a job, it’s important to remember that you are not alone, and there are ways to manage your anxiety.

First, it’s important to understand that feeling anxious during a job search is common. Many people face challenges when looking for work, and sometimes it takes longer than expected. It’s okay to feel frustrated or worried, but try not to let these feelings control you.

One way to reduce anxiety is to create a plan. Set small goals, like updating your resume, applying to a certain number of jobs each week, or practicing for interviews. Having a clear plan can make the job search feel more manageable and less overwhelming.

Another helpful tip is to talk to someone you trust. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can help you feel better. You may also get advice or support that can make the process easier.

It’s also important to take care of yourself. Make sure you are eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Taking breaks to relax and do activities you enjoy can help you manage stress.

If you continue to feel anxious and find it hard to cope, consider seeking professional help. A counselor or therapist can help you manage your anxiety and offer strategies to feel more confident during your job search.

Remember, finding a job can take time. Be patient with yourself and take things one step at a time. You will eventually find the right job for you!

找不到工作时如何应对焦虑

找工作可能会让人感到压力，当事情似乎不顺利时感到焦虑是正常的。如果你正在努力找工作，重要的是要记住你并不孤单，而且有办法控制你的焦虑。

首先，重要的是要明白在找工作时感到焦虑是很常见的。许多人在找工作时面临挑战，有时需要的时间比预期的要长。感到沮丧或担心是正常的，但尽量不要让这些感觉控制你。

减轻焦虑的一种方法是制定计划。设定小目标，比如更新简历、每周申请一定数量的工作或练习面试。有明确的计划可以让求职过程感觉更容易管理，不那么让人不知所措。

另一个有用的技巧是和你信任的人谈谈。有时仅仅谈论你的感受就能让你感觉更好。你还可能会得到建议或支持，让这个过程更容易。

照顾好自己也很重要。确保你吃得好、锻炼身体、睡眠充足。休息放松并做你喜欢的活动可以帮助你缓解压力。

如果你仍然感到焦虑，难以应对，可以考虑寻求专业帮助。辅导员或治疗师可以帮助你控制焦虑，并提供策略让你在求职期间更有信心。

记住，找工作需要时间。对自己要有耐心，一步一步来。你最终会找到适合自己的工作！

A Day at the Beach with My Girlfriend

Going to the beach is a perfect way to spend time with someone you love. Last weekend, I went to the beach with my girlfriend, and it was a wonderful day full of fun and relaxation.

We arrived in the morning when the sun was shining brightly. The first thing we did was walk along the shore. The sand was soft under our feet, and the sound of the waves was very calming. We held hands and talked about our favorite memories.

After that, we went swimming in the ocean. The water was cool and refreshing. We laughed and played in the waves, feeling happy and free. It was so much fun to enjoy the sea together.

Later, we spread a blanket on the sand and had a picnic. We brought sandwiches, fresh fruit, and cold drinks. While we ate, we watched the children playing nearby and the seagulls flying above us. Everything felt peaceful and perfect.

Before leaving, we watched the sunset. The sky turned orange and pink, and the view was beautiful. My girlfriend said it was one of the best moments of her life, and I felt the same.

A trip to the beach is not just about the ocean and the sand. It’s about the memories you create with the people you love. I will always remember this special day with my girlfriend.

Celebrating Lunar New Year

Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is one of the most important holidays in many Asian countries. It is a time for families to come together, celebrate, and welcome the new year with joy and hope.

The date of Lunar New Year changes every year because it is based on the lunar calendar. It usually falls in January or February. Each year is represented by one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, such as the dragon, tiger, or rabbit.

Preparations for the Celebration
Before the new year begins, families clean their homes to remove bad luck and make room for good fortune. They also decorate with red lanterns, paper cuttings, and couplets with lucky phrases. Red is an important color because it symbolizes happiness and good luck.

Family and Food
On New Year’s Eve, families gather for a big reunion dinner. The meal often includes dishes like dumplings, fish, rice cakes, and spring rolls. Each dish has a special meaning. For example, eating fish symbolizes abundance, and dumplings represent wealth.

Traditions and Fun
During the celebration, people give red envelopes (hongbao) with money to children and younger family members as a symbol of good luck. Fireworks and lion dances are also popular activities to scare away evil spirits and bring happiness. Many people wear new clothes, often in red, to start the year fresh.

Wishing for a Good Year
Lunar New Year is not just about the food and traditions. It is a time to reflect on the past year and wish for health, happiness, and success in the year ahead. People greet each other with phrases like “Gong Xi Fa Cai” (Wishing you wealth) or “Xin Nian Kuai Le” (Happy New Year).

This holiday brings joy and unity to families and communities, making it a special time for everyone who celebrates it.

The Dangers of Illegal Driving and Crime

Illegal driving is a serious issue that can lead to accidents, injuries, and even death. It is not just dangerous for the driver but also for other people on the road. Illegal driving includes actions like speeding, running red lights, driving without a license, or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

When people drive illegally, they break the law. This is not only a risk to public safety but also a crime. Breaking traffic laws can lead to fines, losing your license, or even jail time. For example, driving under the influence is a major crime in many countries because it causes thousands of accidents every year.

Telling the truth is very important when it comes to illegal driving. If someone gets caught breaking the law and lies about it, they can face even worse consequences. Honesty is always the best choice, and taking responsibility for your actions shows maturity and respect for the law.

How to Stay Safe and Legal

1. Always follow the traffic rules. Stop at red lights, drive within the speed limit, and respect pedestrians.

2. Never drive without a valid license. If you are not ready to drive, wait until you pass your test and get your license.

3. Avoid distractions while driving, like using your phone or eating. Stay focused on the road.

4. Never drink alcohol or use drugs before driving. If you are not sober, ask someone else to drive or use public transportation.

5. Be honest if you make a mistake. If you get into trouble, telling the truth can help you solve the problem more easily.

Driving is a privilege, not a right. When you drive responsibly, you protect yourself and others. Breaking the law not only causes harm but can also damage your future. Always choose to follow the rules and stay safe on the road.

Buying a New Computer: Over $3000

A good computer can make your work, studies, and entertainment much easier. If you are planning to buy a new computer and your budget is over $3000, you can get a high-performance machine with excellent features.

Why Buy a High-End Computer?
A computer over $3000 is usually designed for specific tasks like gaming, video editing, or professional work. These computers have powerful processors, high-quality graphics cards, and a lot of storage space. They are also faster and more durable than cheaper models.

For example:

Gamers will enjoy smooth gameplay with high-resolution graphics.
Content creators can edit videos or photos without lag.
Professionals can use complex software for design, engineering, or programming efficiently.
What to Look For in a Computer
When buying a high-end computer, consider the following:

Processor (CPU): A fast processor like Intel i9 or AMD Ryzen 9 ensures your computer runs smoothly.
Graphics Card (GPU): For gaming or creative work, choose a strong GPU like NVIDIA RTX 4080 or higher.
RAM: At least 32GB of RAM is ideal for multitasking and handling large files.
Storage: Get an SSD with at least 1TB for fast performance and enough space for your files.
Screen Quality: If it’s a laptop, look for a high-resolution display (4K is excellent for this budget).
Where to Shop
With a budget over $3000, you can find great options in stores or online. Some popular brands for high-end computers are:

Apple: MacBook Pro or iMac for professionals and creatives.
Dell: Alienware for gaming or XPS for performance.
HP and ASUS: High-performance laptops and desktops.
Final Tip
Before buying, check reviews, compare models, and think about what you need. A $3000+ computer is an investment, so choose wisely to ensure it meets your requirements for years to come.

Understanding Libido: What You Need to Know

Libido, or sexual desire, is a natural part of human life. It varies from person to person and can be influenced by many factors, including age, health, lifestyle, and emotions. Understanding libido can help people maintain healthy relationships and personal well-being.

What Affects Libido?
Physical Health: Good health often supports a healthy libido. Conditions like hormonal imbalances, chronic illnesses, or medications can lower sexual desire.

Mental Health: Stress, anxiety, or depression can decrease libido. Feeling mentally healthy and relaxed often improves sexual desire.

Relationships: Trust and communication in a relationship play a big role in libido. Conflicts or lack of emotional connection can affect desire.

Lifestyle: Factors like lack of sleep, poor diet, and not exercising can lower energy and libido. Staying active and eating well can boost it.

Hormones: Hormonal changes during life stages like puberty, pregnancy, or menopause can affect libido

How to Improve Libido
Healthy Lifestyle: Exercise regularly, eat nutritious food, and get enough sleep to boost energy and mood.

Reduce Stress: Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga to lower stress and improve overall well-being.

Communication: Talk openly with your partner about your feelings and needs. Emotional closeness often increases sexual desire.

Seek Help if Needed: If low libido is affecting your life or relationships, consult a doctor or therapist. They can help identify and treat underlying issues.

Respecting Individual Differences
Everyone’s libido is different, and that’s okay. Some people have a higher desire, while others may have less. It’s important to respect your own feelings and those of your partner.

Sexual health is an essential part of overall well-being. By understanding libido and taking care of your health, you can maintain a balanced and happy life.

A Fun Day at Home with My Girlfriend

Last weekend, my parents went on a short trip, and I had the house to myself. I invited my girlfriend over, and we spent the day together. It was a simple but very enjoyable day.

First, we decided to watch a movie. We picked a comedy because we both love to laugh. We made some popcorn, sat on the couch, and enjoyed the film. It was nice to relax and spend time together without any distractions.

After the movie, we played video games. I showed her my favorite games, and we had so much fun competing against each other. She even won a few rounds, which made her very happy.

Later, we cooked dinner together. We made pasta and a salad. It was a bit messy in the kitchen, but we laughed a lot while cooking. The food turned out great, and we were proud of our little “teamwork” project.

Before the day ended, we sat outside in the garden and talked about our future plans. It felt good to share our dreams and goals. Spending quiet moments like this made me appreciate her even more.

Having a day like this reminded me that you don’t need to go anywhere special to have a good time. Sometimes, the best moments are the simple ones spent with the person you care about the most.

Understanding Cuckold

"Cuckold" is a term that historically means a man whose wife is unfaithful. The word comes from the cuckoo bird, known for laying its eggs in other birds' nests. 

In modern times, the meaning has expanded, especially in certain subcultures. Now, "cuckold" or "cuck" can refer to a man who knows or even encourages his partner to be with someone else sexually, often as part of a consensual relationship dynamic. This practice is sometimes called "cuckolding."

Cuckolding can be part of a fetish or lifestyle where both partners agree to the arrangement. It's about trust, communication, and setting boundaries. Not everyone understands or agrees with this practice, but for those involved, it can be an expression of love and trust in unique ways.

It's important to approach this topic with respect, understanding that what works for one couple might not work for another. Consent and open communication are key.

This essay provides a basic introduction to the concept while avoiding overly complex language or detailed explanations.

Cuckold and Porn

"Cuckold" or "cuck" refers to a man whose partner has sex with someone else, often with his knowledge or consent. 

In porn:

Scenario: The cuckold watches or is aware that his partner is with another man. This might involve him watching live, through video, or just being told about it afterwards.
Consent: Both partners agree to this setup. It's about trust and communication.
Porn Process: 
Actors role-play this scenario. 
The cuckold might be shown as humiliated or aroused by the situation, depending on the script or genre of the porn.
Filming involves setting up cameras, ensuring all participants are comfortable and consensual, and often includes discussions or "confessions" between the characters.
Popularity: This theme has a specific audience who find this dynamic exciting or erotic.

Remember, in real life, this should only happen with clear consent from everyone involved. In porn, it's acted out for viewers, but the actors' welfare should always come first.

The Whispering Hallway

It was on a chilly October night that I found myself walking down the old, creaky hallway of my great-aunt's abandoned mansion. The air was thick with dust and the musty scent of years gone by. My flashlight barely pierced through the dark, casting eerie shadows on the peeling wallpaper.

I was there to collect some old family photos, but as I ventured deeper into the house, the feeling of being watched grew stronger. The silence was suddenly broken by whispers, so faint yet clear, like a distant conversation carried by the wind.

Following the sound, I ended up in front of an ancient mirror at the end of the hallway. My reflection was not alone; beside me stood the translucent figure of a woman, her dress from another era, her eyes hollow yet filled with sorrow. She seemed to be speaking, but no sound came from her lips.

Fear gripped me, yet I couldn't move. Her gaze was locked onto mine, and for a moment, I felt an overwhelming sadness, not my own but hers. She reached out, her hand passing through the glass, touching the air where my heart would be.

The whispers grew louder, now not just around me but inside my head, a sad tale of love lost, of waiting in vain. Then, as abruptly as she appeared, she faded away, leaving me in the cold, silent hallway.

I left the mansion that night, the photos forgotten, my heart racing with the encounter. The experience was so vivid, I often wonder if it was real or if the old house had just played tricks on my mind. But on quiet nights, I sometimes hear those whispers again, a haunting reminder of the ghost in the hallway.

#### 1，Hard To Love

```
When I was just a kid
I couldn't wait til I grew up
Tried walking in your shoes
But couldn't even tie them up
No matter how big and tall I grew
I was always looking up to you

You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You helped me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love

When I dropped out of school
You told me that my time was up
I was a rebel with a cause
Just didn't quite know what it was
So I got a job that barely paid
You said you did the same thing at my age

You showed me that I was just a diamond in the rough
You helped me to grow into the man that I've become
We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love

We've been down, we've been up
I hope I've made you proud enough
You make it look easy even when I'm hard to love
Even when I'm hard to love
```

```
Tie them up - 把它们绑起来 tai Tie up
Diamond - 钻石
Rough - 粗糙的 ra
We've been down, we've been up - 我们经历过低谷，也攀登过高峰
Even when - 即使
Rebel - 反叛 lag bo renegades 叛徒 lag ne gags government
Quite - 相当；完全
Barely paid - 几乎没有支付/工资很低 ber li
Just didn't quite know what it was - 只是不太知道那是什么
Barely - 仅仅；几乎不
```

```
当我还是个孩子的时候
我迫不及待地想长大
试着穿上你的鞋子走路
但却无法系好鞋带
无论我长得多高大
我总是仰望着你

你让我知道我只是一颗未经雕琢的钻石
你帮助我成长为现在的男人
我们一起经历过低谷，也一起经历过高潮
我希望我让你足够骄傲
你让我看起来很容易，即使我很难被爱

当我辍学的时候
你告诉我我的时代已经到了
我是一个有原因的叛逆者
只是不太清楚那是什么
所以我找到了一份薪水微薄的工作
你说你在我这个年纪也做过同样的事情

你让我知道我只是一颗未经雕琢的钻石
你帮助我成长为现在的男人
我们一起经历过低谷，也一起经历过高潮
我希望我让你足够骄傲
你让我看起来很容易，即使我很难被爱

我们一起经历过低谷，我们已经在一起了
我希望我让你足够骄傲
你让一切看起来很容易，即使我很难爱
即使我很难爱
```



#### 2，Delusion:All

```
They'll conquer us if we divide
And no one will listen to you
We gotta stand up and draw a line
It's time to fall back or shoot

Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted

But maybe we're delusional
We're all de-fucking-lusional

When everything's supposed to happen for a reason
And every talking head expects ya to believe them
But we don't need them, we are the kingdom
We know the amount that we have shared was never even

Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted

I know
In order to be free, you gotta let go
But know that once you do, that's when they take hold
Everything's fair in love and war, so

Why does it feel like they don't feel anything?
I pray there's a future behind those walls, but maybe I'm delusional
Let's make a deal, pretend this bastard democracy
Is just how we want it and we're not exhausted

But maybe we're delusional
But maybe we're delusional
We are delusional, whoa
We're all de-fucking-lusional

Talking head

这是一个俚语，通常指的是在媒体上发表观点的人，比如新闻主播、评论员、专家等。
它有时带有轻微的讽刺意味，暗示这些人只是说话或表达观点，但未必有真正的权威性或可信度。

“我们知道我们分享的数量从来都不均等。”

详细解释：
We know

表示一种清楚的认识或承认。
The amount that we have shared

指的是双方或多方之间分享的内容，可以是时间、金钱、情感、努力等。
Was never even

Even 在这里是“平等、公平”的意思。
Never even 意思是“从来都不均等”。
综合翻译：
“我们知道我们所分享的东西从来都不是平等的。”

In order 是一个短语，意思是 “为了” 或 “以便”，用来引导目的。

例如：

In order to be free 意思是 “为了获得自由”。
In order to learn, you must practice. 意思是 “为了学习，你必须练习。”


Take hold 的意思是 "占据"、"控制" 或 "开始生效"，取决于上下文。它通常描述某种力量、想法、感觉或现象开始影响某人或某事。

在这句话中：
"But know that once you do, that's when they take hold."
意思是：“但要知道，一旦你这样做了，他们就会开始控制你。”

这里的 take hold 表示某种东西（可能是情感、想法或力量）开始对某人产生影响或控制力。
```

#### 03，Runaway

```
Strung out in the back of a black car
No keys, all I got is my credit cards
And I've been here a million times
Drive fast with the Beatles in the background
Tell 'em take the 101 out of this town
I was never one to say goodbye

Every time I fall in love, I go and fuck it up right when it gets good
Don't you think it's funny?
Don't you think it's funny?
I know I did all the shitty things to you I said I never ever would
Baby, that's so like me
Baby, that's so like me

I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special

Strung out in the back of a black car
I got a little too good at breaking hearts
I wonder if I'll ever stop

Every time I fall in love, I go and fuck it up right when it gets good
Don't you think it's funny?
Don't you think it's funny?
I know I did all the shitty things to you I said I never ever would
But baby, that's so like me
Baby, that's so like me

I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special

What we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
Yeah I know what we had was special

Strung out in the back of a black car
I got a little too good at breaking hearts
I was never one to say goodbye
```

```
Strung out - 精疲力尽；（因压力、疲劳或药物影响）处于崩溃状态 s 壮
Strung out in the back - 在后面筋疲力尽/疲惫不堪
Shitty - 糟糕的；令人讨厌的（俚语，非正式用语） 糟糕
right when 就在那时 恰好在...的时候
I got a little too good 我有点太好了
I got a little too good at breaking hearts 我有点太擅长伤人心了
good at 擅长
```

```
"Strung out" 在这里很可能是指一个人因为药物使用过量、疲惫或某种压力而处于一种精神或身体上的极度疲惫或紧张状态。
"In the back of a black car" 指的是这种状态发生在车子的后座，特别是黑色轿车的后座。

"Tell 'em" 实际上是 "Tell them" 的缩写，意思是“告诉他们”。

"Fuck it up" 意思是搞砸某事。
"Right" 这里用作副词，通常表示“恰好”、“正当”、“就在...之时”

"What we had" 指的是过去的关系、经历或某种共享的体验。
"was special" 强调这种关系或经历具有独特性、重要性或非凡的意义。
```



#### 04，GROWING UP IS _____

```
Heard you moved out of town on the weekend
Understand, but I'm sad that you're leaving
Are you up making friends with the ceiling?
Yeah, I know the feeling
I wasn't trying to let you down
I was just working my shit out
I'm sorry I didn't know how much I led you on

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growing up is

Get emotional at two in the morning
It's a habit, know I shouldn't be callin'
Then you let me in, is that what you wanted?
Is this what we wanted?
Now you're back in town, no, I can't come around
Are we better without the what if's and doubts
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget
And try again?

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growing up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growin' up is

Wish that you were here (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (wish that you were, wish that you were here)

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growin' up is weird

Oh-oh, bet I'll just disappear
Oh, will I just disappear?
Wish that you were here
Growing up is
```



#### 5，r&r

```
I think I need a break from life and love
I never thought that it would be this tough
I wanna sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I think I need a break I do too much
Tomorrow maybe I could have some fun
For now I'll just sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I am tired of the questions that are always just the same
When will you find purpose but never how's your day
Hey I told you I need time to figure out my crazy brain
2020 bummer, threw it all away
Plans for California and a house in West LA
Please dont come through I need time to chill so I don't go insane

I think I need a break from life and love
I never thought that it would be this tough
I wanna sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I think I need a break I do too much
Tomorrow maybe I could have some fun
For now I'll just sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I am just being honest
Something that I could not be
Keepin' up with drama
All the bunch of make belief
I heard a little voice inside my head
He pulled me to the side and then he said
Sail on now and never look back
And you'll learn how to finally unpack
That's the point of life you try your best
And sure I understand but

I think I need a break from life and love
I never thought that it would be this tough
I wanna sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I think I need a break I do too much
Tomorrow maybe I could have some fun
For now I'll just sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I dont need a conversation
I just need some meditation
Catchin' up with all my favorite shows
Woaah

I think I need a break from life and love
I never thought that it would be this tough
I wanna sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

I think I need a break I do too much
Tomorrow maybe I could have some fun
For now I'll just sleep 'til sunset
Rest up, relax, and reset

"And you'll learn how to finally unpack" 的意思是 "你将学会如何最终解开"。

这里的 "unpack" 不一定指实际的打开行李箱或包裹，而是比喻意义上的解开某个复杂的事情或情绪。通常用于指一种精神上、情感上或心理上的解开，例如理解自己或解决一个困扰自己的问题。

"Catchin' up" 是 "catching up" 的缩写，意思是 赶上、追上、重新建立联系

"Bummer" 是一个口语词，通常用来表示 失望、遗憾、令人沮丧的事情。当你说某件事是 "a bummer" 时，意味着它让你感到不开心或失望。

在句子 "2020 bummer, threw it all away" 中，"bummer" 表示2020年是一个让人失望或很不愉快的年份，而 "threw it all away" 则表示放弃了什么东西或者浪费了什么。因此，这句话可能是在说2020年发生了一些让人失望的事情，导致他们觉得这一年浪费了很多机会或付出的努力。

总结一下，"bummer" 在这里表示对2020年的失望和无奈。
