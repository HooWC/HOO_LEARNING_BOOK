I love horror movie, today we'll talking about horror movie, why love?

When I was little, I was very scared of watching horror movies because I was afraid to go to the toilet or sleep alone after finishing them. To be honest, only horror movies could leave a deep impression on me. Now that I am an adult, I love watching horror movies because they help me relieve the stress of daily life.

As an adult, I have to deal with many tasks every day, such as school assignments, finding a job, preparing for interviews, coding questions, or improving my major. These responsibilities can be overwhelming at times.

So whenever night comes, I watch horror movies to relax. Not only horror movies but also thrillers can help me feel relieved.

I enjoy watching ghost stories or movies about killers now. I no longer feel scared because the pressures of modern life are much scarier than anything in a horror movie.
