I love horror movie, today we'll talking about horror movie, why love?

When I was little, I was very scared of watching horror movies because I was afraid to go to the toilet or sleep alone after finishing them. To be honest, only horror movies could leave a deep impression on me. Now that I am an adult, I love watching horror movies because they help me relieve the stress of daily life.

As an adult, I have to deal with many tasks every day, such as school assignments, finding a job, preparing for interviews, coding questions, or improving my major. These responsibilities can be overwhelming at times.

So whenever night comes, I watch horror movies to relax. Not only horror movies but also thrillers can help me feel relieved.

I enjoy watching ghost stories or movies about killers now. I no longer feel scared because the pressures of modern life are much scarier than anything in a horror movie.

## 02， Human Nature & Crim

```
People living in society, there're 50% people will got anxiety disorder. Because people will go to thinking about their life, family, money, love etc. But, for me, I already got anxiety disorder three years, it really make me every days so painful. I seems can't sleep well and focus on study.

But today topic is not about anxiety disorder, is talking about crim. I watch a lot of youtube video about people crim in America. I already watch five or six police arrest crim video today, and I was always thinking about that why those come from Chinese students will not life well in america instead choose to lie people or kill others.

I watch a lot of video is about Chinese be arrest by police, and kill wife, go to super market to steal stuff and ready to lie others. Even thought those video Chinese crim always say they english is not very good, and can't speak english. But they will know the active is illegal, I just want say that, your rnglish not good is ok, but just don't do about illegal active, just don't hurt others.

To be honest, I very hate those whos lie people crim, I really hope they can always stay in the prison, no out.

People living in society face many pressures, and around 50% of them may develop anxiety disorders. This is because people constantly worry about their life, family, money, love, and so on. As for me, I have been suffering from an anxiety disorder for three years, and it has been incredibly painful. I often cannot sleep well or focus on my studies.

However, today's topic is not about anxiety disorders; it is about crime. I watch many YouTube videos about crimes in America. Today alone, I have watched five or six videos of police arresting criminals. One thing that always makes me think is why some Chinese students in America fail to live a good life and instead choose to deceive others or even commit violent crimes.

I have seen many videos about Chinese people being arrested by the police. Some killed their wives, some stole items from supermarkets, and some cheated others. Even though these criminals often claim that their English is not very good and they cannot communicate well, they must know that their actions are illegal. I just want to say that it is okay if your English is not perfect, but do not commit illegal acts or harm others.

To be honest, I really hate those who deceive or harm others. I strongly believe they should stay in prison and never be allowed to go free.

Hi everyone, today I want to talk about myself. First, I’m 25 years old, but many things have happened in my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder three years ago, and I still struggle with it now. I am a graduate student who has already finished school with very high scores, but I haven’t been able to find a job recently.

That’s why I’ve been feeling anxious again lately. I’m so worried about finding a job. I have applied to many jobs, both remote and office-based, and I went through eight interviews last month. It was exhausting, painful, and stressful.

The year 2025 has just started, and on the first day, I applied for one job and began working to improve my English and listening skills. Today, the second day of 2025, I have already applied to nine jobs. To be honest, it has made me feel very tired and overwhelmed. Now, it’s time for me to learn and improve my English, so I decided to write this English composition to practice my writing skills.

Finally, I cannot stop learning. When I stop learning or watch videos or play games, I feel anxious and stressed. I believe I must improve myself quickly because I don’t have much time to waste. I need to grow up faster. This is the only way for me to build confidence and secure a job.

Recently, I’ve had a headache for a week and have encountered many challenges and people in my life. However, I am no longer afraid of interviews because I’ve gotten used to them. I will continue to learn and improve my English every day. I can already see significant improvement; for example, I can write an English composition now, and this one is already over 200 words long.

I recently built a daily routine plan for myself because it makes me feel secure and confident. When you finish your work or tasks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment and a good mood.

Let’s get into today’s topic. Every morning, I will focus on learning and improving my English. In the afternoon, I will search for jobs and submit applications. At night, I will continue to learn new English words and practice my listening skills.

Even though I have attended many interviews, and no company has offered me a job yet, I won’t give up. I will keep improving myself. I am very clear about my weakness, which is my English. So, I spend a lot of time learning and improving my English and listening skills. I don’t want to be looked down upon by interviewers again.

This is my daily routine plan: learn and apply for jobs. The meaning of this routine is to never give up.

There are many ways to learn and improve your English. For example, you can write an English composition every day, review the English words you’ve learned before, or read online English articles.

It is important to stay calm when applying for jobs. Read the job description carefully to see if it fits your interests. Don’t apply to many jobs out of anxiety. That’s why I suggest staying calm and thinking carefully before applying.

Finally, you can use a text file or other applications to build your daily routine plan. Make it clear and easy to understand. Reflect on what you’ve achieved or learned after completing your daily routine. Lastly, and most importantly, don’t give up! Keep it up, bro; you are not alone.
