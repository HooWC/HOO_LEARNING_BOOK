I love horror movie, today we'll talking about horror movie, why love?

When I was little, I was very scared of watching horror movies because I was afraid to go to the toilet or sleep alone after finishing them. To be honest, only horror movies could leave a deep impression on me. Now that I am an adult, I love watching horror movies because they help me relieve the stress of daily life.

As an adult, I have to deal with many tasks every day, such as school assignments, finding a job, preparing for interviews, coding questions, or improving my major. These responsibilities can be overwhelming at times.

So whenever night comes, I watch horror movies to relax. Not only horror movies but also thrillers can help me feel relieved.

I enjoy watching ghost stories or movies about killers now. I no longer feel scared because the pressures of modern life are much scarier than anything in a horror movie.

## 02， Human Nature & Crim

```
People living in society, there're 50% people will got anxiety disorder. Because people will go to thinking about their life, family, money, love etc. But, for me, I already got anxiety disorder three years, it really make me every days so painful. I seems can't sleep well and focus on study.

But today topic is not about anxiety disorder, is talking about crim. I watch a lot of youtube video about people crim in America. I already watch five or six police arrest crim video today, and I was always thinking about that why those come from Chinese students will not life well in america instead choose to lie people or kill others.

I watch a lot of video is about Chinese be arrest by police, and kill wife, go to super market to steal stuff and ready to lie others. Even thought those video Chinese crim always say they english is not very good, and can't speak english. But they will know the active is illegal, I just want say that, your rnglish not good is ok, but just don't do about illegal active, just don't hurt others.

To be honest, I very hate those whos lie people crim, I really hope they can always stay in the prison, no out.

People living in society face many pressures, and around 50% of them may develop anxiety disorders. This is because people constantly worry about their life, family, money, love, and so on. As for me, I have been suffering from an anxiety disorder for three years, and it has been incredibly painful. I often cannot sleep well or focus on my studies.

However, today's topic is not about anxiety disorders; it is about crime. I watch many YouTube videos about crimes in America. Today alone, I have watched five or six videos of police arresting criminals. One thing that always makes me think is why some Chinese students in America fail to live a good life and instead choose to deceive others or even commit violent crimes.

I have seen many videos about Chinese people being arrested by the police. Some killed their wives, some stole items from supermarkets, and some cheated others. Even though these criminals often claim that their English is not very good and they cannot communicate well, they must know that their actions are illegal. I just want to say that it is okay if your English is not perfect, but do not commit illegal acts or harm others.

To be honest, I really hate those who deceive or harm others. I strongly believe they should stay in prison and never be allowed to go free.

Hi everyone, today I want to talk about myself. First, I’m 25 years old, but many things have happened in my life. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder three years ago, and I still struggle with it now. I am a graduate student who has already finished school with very high scores, but I haven’t been able to find a job recently.

That’s why I’ve been feeling anxious again lately. I’m so worried about finding a job. I have applied to many jobs, both remote and office-based, and I went through eight interviews last month. It was exhausting, painful, and stressful.

The year 2025 has just started, and on the first day, I applied for one job and began working to improve my English and listening skills. Today, the second day of 2025, I have already applied to nine jobs. To be honest, it has made me feel very tired and overwhelmed. Now, it’s time for me to learn and improve my English, so I decided to write this English composition to practice my writing skills.

Finally, I cannot stop learning. When I stop learning or watch videos or play games, I feel anxious and stressed. I believe I must improve myself quickly because I don’t have much time to waste. I need to grow up faster. This is the only way for me to build confidence and secure a job.

Recently, I’ve had a headache for a week and have encountered many challenges and people in my life. However, I am no longer afraid of interviews because I’ve gotten used to them. I will continue to learn and improve my English every day. I can already see significant improvement; for example, I can write an English composition now, and this one is already over 200 words long.

I recently built a daily routine plan for myself because it makes me feel secure and confident. When you finish your work or tasks, you will feel a sense of accomplishment and a good mood.

Let’s get into today’s topic. Every morning, I will focus on learning and improving my English. In the afternoon, I will search for jobs and submit applications. At night, I will continue to learn new English words and practice my listening skills.

Even though I have attended many interviews, and no company has offered me a job yet, I won’t give up. I will keep improving myself. I am very clear about my weakness, which is my English. So, I spend a lot of time learning and improving my English and listening skills. I don’t want to be looked down upon by interviewers again.

This is my daily routine plan: learn and apply for jobs. The meaning of this routine is to never give up.

There are many ways to learn and improve your English. For example, you can write an English composition every day, review the English words you’ve learned before, or read online English articles.

It is important to stay calm when applying for jobs. Read the job description carefully to see if it fits your interests. Don’t apply to many jobs out of anxiety. That’s why I suggest staying calm and thinking carefully before applying.

Finally, you can use a text file or other applications to build your daily routine plan. Make it clear and easy to understand. Reflect on what you’ve achieved or learned after completing your daily routine. Lastly, and most importantly, don’t give up! Keep it up, bro; you are not alone.

## 05，What Is Language

```
Today topic is what is language, there are a lot of language exist in this earth. But English language is most people understand and speak. But ther are something I want to say is what is laguage. Even though interviewer, company boss and some of the people also don't understand what is language.

Why people make language, why people communicate in language, because language is use for others can understand what I talk to they.

For example, many people like to speak English faster, and then others cann't understand. It's just talk to theyself, because there are not the all people can speak well English or listening. So they can speak slowing, and others can understand, this is the right way to speaking and what mean is language.

Language is use for each other can understand what they speak, so this is the right way to speak language insteal speaking faster. I know that there are lots of peope like speak English faster for showing their English so good. But it's a wrong way, and it's so bad.

Language is not showing how you English well, the right concept about language is people can understand what you say, so this is language, if people cann't understand, you can conversation well with they.

Finally, language is not just for communicate, it's also can help people understanding that people thought, idea and meaning.So try to speak English slowly that help people can understand what you mean.

Today's topic is: What is language? There are many languages that exist on this earth, but English is the most widely understood and spoken language. However, there is something I want to say about language. Even interviewers, company bosses, and some people don’t fully understand what language is.

Why did people create language? Why do people communicate using language? The answer is that language allows people to understand what I am saying to them.

For example, many people like to speak English quickly, but others cannot understand. If you speak too fast, it’s like talking to yourself, because not everyone speaks English well or can understand it. So, it's better to speak slowly so others can understand. This is the right way to speak, and this is what language is for.

Language is meant for people to understand each other. Speaking too quickly is not the right way. I know that many people like to speak English quickly to show off their English skills, but that is the wrong approach, and it’s not helpful.

Language is not about showing how good your English is. The right concept of language is that people can understand what you say. If others cannot understand you, then you cannot have a good conversation with them.

Finally, language is not just for communication; it also helps people understand each other's thoughts, ideas, and meanings. So, try to speak English slowly to help others understand what you mean.

There are many types of music. Some people enjoy listening to pop or rap, while others prefer songs in English or other languages. As for me, rock music is my favorite.

I first started listening to rock music in 2018. The first rock songs I heard were from American bands. America has produced many famous rock bands, such as Bring Me the Horizon and Linkin Park. However, my all-time favorite rock band is One Ok Rock.

I enjoy studying while listening to One Ok Rock’s music because it makes me feel excited and passionate, motivating me to keep going and move forward. One Ok Rock’s music is not just about rock; it also contains warmth, encouragement, and fighting spirit. Many of their songs talk about not giving up, staying strong, and continuing to fight, even when life feels too painful to move on.

This is why so many people love their music. As I mentioned, their songs are full of power, encouragement, and messages about never giving up. I would recommend One Ok Rock to my friends and family because their music truly inspires us to keep moving forward.

Finally, some people might think that rock music is too noisy. As a big fan of rock music, I want to say that this noisiness is a unique feature of rock. It’s part of what makes it special. The energy and noise of rock music help people forget the stress of daily life and immerse themselves in the world of music.

A Little Boy Walking Alone

Today is Friday. When I started washing my car, I saw a little boy walking slowly on the road. He looked about five or seven years old. I decided to approach him and gently asked, "Hey, little boy, why are you here? Why aren't you at school?"

The little boy replied, "I... I missed the school bus, so I decided to walk to school."

Hearing this, I invited the little boy to sit on a chair on the porch. Then, I decided to call the police. While waiting, I sat beside him and started a conversation.

"It's very dangerous for a seven-year-old to walk alone on the road," I said. "There are lots of bad people in this world. If you ever miss the school bus again, go back home and call your parents to take you to school by car, okay?"

The little boy stayed quiet and nodded.

About ten minutes later, the police arrived. One of the officers sat beside the boy and gently asked, "Hey, how's your day? Why are you here? Can you tell me what happened?"

The boy replied slowly, "I... I just missed the school bus, and I needed to get to school."

The police decided to take the boy back home. When they arrived, they knocked on the door, but no one answered. After calling out loudly, “Hello? Is anyone home?” and still receiving no response, they entered the house.

Inside, they found the boy’s mother still sleeping in bed. Startled, she asked nervously, "What... what happened?"

One officer put away his gun and replied, "Why was your child walking alone on the road while you were still sleeping?"

The woman, visibly nervous, answered, "Which child? I have three children, and the others are still sleeping at home."

The officer responded, "The seven-year-old one."

In the end, the parents received a fine for neglecting their child’s safety.

This story is a reminder to all parents: never let your child walk alone on the road. It’s a very dangerous thing to do.
